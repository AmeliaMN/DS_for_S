# ggplot2_tutorial
Basic introduction to ggplot2 for UCLA DataFest 2015

This is the source code for my presentation on ggplot2 for the pre-DataFest workshop on April 22 2015. The most useful files for you are probably tutorial.R and the ggplot2-cheatsheet.pdf that I got from the RStudio website.

If you want to follow along with my slides, I've posted them [on my website](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~amelia.mcnamara/ggplot2_tutorial.html#1). Warning: this presentation is taking a long while to load on my website. Just be patient, or download the html/pdf slides from github and run it locally.
